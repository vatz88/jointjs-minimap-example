Minimaps are a great way to viualize large graphs. [Rappid](https://www.jointjs.com) does have a feature called [Navigator](http://resources.jointjs.com/docs/rappid/v2.3/ui.html#ui.Navigator). But Rappid is a paid library build on top of JointJS. [JointJS](https://www.jointjs.com/opensource) is open source and free to use library.

This simple example shows how to build minimap directly with JointJS. See the example running [here](https://vatz88.github.io/jointjs-minimap-example/).

Implementation in this example only demonstrates the approach, code can be better optimized.
